# SpringBootPhonebookApplication

In this Spring Boot App , I have implemented RESTful web services APIs for CRUD operations on a MySQL database. The CRUD operations include Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete.

used:
Java Development Kit (JDK 1.8 or newer)
MySQL Database server (including MySQL Workbench and MySQL Command Line Client to manage database)
A Java IDE (Eclipse IDE)
curl (to test RESTful APIs)
